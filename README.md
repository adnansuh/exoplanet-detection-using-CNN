# exoplanet-detection-using-CNN
The project aims to leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyse the flux data and accurately classify stars as either exoplanet-stars or non-exoplanet-stars. By training a model on the provided dataset, we seek to uncover patterns and features indicative of exoplanet presence, enabling the model to make predictiion.
